# Body_Motion_Classifier_2

# This will classify a person's activity (laying, sitting, standing, walking,
# walking downstairs, walking upstairs) based on body-motion data obtained
# from a Samsung Galaxy smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope.

# Data come from Univ. of California Irvine Machine Learning Lab
# 79 variables of body motion, measured for 30 subjects and 6 activities,
# yields 180 observations each of 79 variables.
# Activities are: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walkupstairs, walkdownstairs

# Classification is accomplished by correlating observations with a reference spectra
# Reference spectra are derived by computing an average of each variable for each
# activity type.
